    <p>
      This Privacy Policy explains how Bull Terrier Buddy ("we", "our", "us") handles information
      when you use the Bull Terrier Buddy mobile app and this website.
    </p>

    <h2>1. What Bull Terrier Buddy Stores</h2>
    <p>Bull Terrier Buddy is a local-first app. The app stores data on your device, including:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Dog profile information:</strong> name, breed, sex, birth date, coat color, microchip/KC/neutered status, allergies, and owner notes.</li>
      <li><strong>Health and care tracking data:</strong> exercise, weight/body condition, behavior, skin/coat, mobility, hearing, cardiac, medication, care plan items, and vet cost logs.</li>
      <li><strong>Food checker preferences:</strong> favorites and in-app settings such as unit and currency preferences.</li>
      <li><strong>Optional dog photo:</strong> if you choose one from your photo library.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>2. What We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>No account sign-up is required in the current app version.</li>
      <li>No personal identifiers are collected by us through a backend service.</li>
      <li>No in-app analytics, ad tracking SDK, or crash-reporting SDK is integrated in the current app codebase.</li>
      <li>No payment card details are collected by us in the current app version.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>3. How Data Is Used</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>To power app features you choose to use, such as logs, reminders, profile views, and calculations.</li>
      <li>To save and restore your data locally between app sessions.</li>
      <li>To import/export backup files when you initiate backup or restore.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>4. Permissions and Device Access</h2>
    <p>Bull Terrier Buddy may request:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Photo library access:</strong> only to let you select a dog photo for a profile.</li>
      <li><strong>File access:</strong> only for user-initiated backup export and restore import.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>We do not access camera, microphone, contacts, or location in the current app code.</p>

    <h2>5. Backup Files</h2>
    <p>
      If you use the backup feature, your app data is exported to a JSON file at a location you choose.
      That file is under your control and is not automatically uploaded by us.
    </p>

    <h2>6. Data Sharing</h2>
    <p>
      We do not sell your data. In the current app architecture, app data stays on your device unless
      you manually export/share it yourself.
    </p>

    <h2>7. Data Retention</h2>
    <p>
      Data remains on your device until you delete it in-app, clear app data, uninstall the app,
      or overwrite it by importing a different backup.
    </p>

    <h2>8. Security</h2>
    <p>
      We use reasonable safeguards in app design, but no storage system is fully risk-free.
      You are responsible for protecting your device, backups, and any files you share.
    </p>

    <h2>9. Children’s Privacy</h2>
    <p>
      Bull Terrier Buddy is not directed to children under 13. Because the app is local-first and does not
      require account creation in its current version, we do not knowingly collect children’s personal data through a server.
    </p>

    <h2>10. Your Choices</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Do not add optional data you do not want stored.</li>
      <li>Remove data in-app, or uninstall the app to remove local app data.</li>
      <li>Control backup files directly in your device/cloud storage accounts.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>11. Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>
      If app functionality changes (for example, new cloud features), this policy will be updated
      before or at the time those changes are released.
    </p>

    <h2>12. Disclaimer</h2>
    <p>
      Bull Terrier Buddy provides general educational information and tracking tools for dog owners.
      It is not a substitute for professional veterinary advice, diagnosis, or treatment.
      Always consult a qualified veterinarian for guidance about your dog's health, behavior, and treatment decisions.
      In emergencies, contact your veterinarian or local emergency animal hospital immediately.
